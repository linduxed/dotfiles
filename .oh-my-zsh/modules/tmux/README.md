tmux
====

Defines [tmux][1] aliases and provides for auto launching it at start-up.

Aliases
-------

 - `ta` attach or switch to a tmux session.
 - `tl` list sessions managed by the tmux server.

Settings
--------

### Auto-start

Start a tmux session automatically when Zsh is launched.

To enable this feature, add the following line to *zshrc*:

    zstyle ':omz:module:tmux' auto-start 'yes'

It will create a background session named _#OMZ_ and attach every new shell to
it.

To avoid keeping open sessions, this module sets `destroy-unattached off` on
the background session and `destroy-unattached on` on every other session
(global setting).

Caveats
-------

On Mac OS X, launching tmux can cause the error **launch_msg(...): Socket is not
connected** to be displayed, which can be fixed by installing
[reattach-to-user-namespace][3], available in [Homebrew][4], and adding the
following to *tmux.conf*:

    set-option -g default-command "reattach-to-user-namespace -l $SHELL -l"

Furthermore, tmux is known to cause **kernel panics** on Mac OS X. A discussion
about this and OMZ has already been opened [here][2].
