tmux
====

Defines [tmux][1] aliases and provides for auto launching it at start-up.

Aliases
-------

 - `ta` attach or switch to a tmux session.
 - `tl` list sessions managed by the tmux server.

Settings
--------

### Auto-start

Start a tmux session automatically when Zsh is launched.

To enable this feature, add the following line to *zshrc*:

    zstyle ':omz:module:tmux' auto-start 'yes'

It will create a background session named _#OMZ_ and attach every new shell to
it.

To avoid keeping open sessions, this module sets `destroy-unattached off` on
the background session and `destroy-unattached on` on every other session
(global setting).

Caveats
-------

tmux is known to cause kernel panics on Mac OS X. A discussion about this and
OMZ has already been opened [here][2].
