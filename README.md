linduxed's dotfiles
===================

This repo houses almost everything I need to have one of my systems configured to my liking.
There's all kinds of stuff in here and some things might not be used anymore, but I try to clean things up from time to time.

I use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to organize my dotfiles.
I don't yet use the various features rcm provides for setting up host-specific configuration, but some day I'll make an effort to replace my own improvised solutions with those.
